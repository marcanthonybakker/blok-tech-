# Target Audience

Think about your target audience. It always helps to have one core audience you will be designing for. For example; sport fanatics to match people based on sports, netflixers to match people based on what series they want to watch etc. 

- What do you know about these people
- What are their wishes and challenges? 
- Can you find more information about them online? 
- Can you talk to a few members of your target audience to ask them what they think is important?
